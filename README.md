# ForwardKinematicView

I made this simple python script to help me view how the DH parameters works in forward kinematic.

## Setup

- First ```git clone``` this repo
- Create an virtual environment with ```python -m venv venv```
- Activate it by running in terminal ```venv/Scripts/Activate```
- Then install the required libs with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Finally execute it ```python main.py```
